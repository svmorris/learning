This little project would be the ability to render seperate objects that can move independantly at the same time.


This would be best done if the Framework class got renamed to Window and only handled the very basics of rendering. (ei: clear, draw pixel, render) The rest of the objects would get their own class, with their own move methods and stuff. (inheritance might be useful here.)
